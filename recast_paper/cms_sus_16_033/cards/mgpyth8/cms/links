The MG cards we use for the gridpacks are based on the templates stored here:
https://github.com/CMS-SUS-XPAG/GenLHEfiles/tree/master/GridpackWorkflow/production
e.g. for go go proc card:
https://github.com/CMS-SUS-XPAG/GenLHEfiles/blob/master/GridpackWorkflow/production/SMS-GlGl/templatecards/SMS-GlGl_proc_card.dat
The slha depend on the decay, the models we have are listed here:
https://github.com/CMS-SUS-XPAG/GenLHEfiles/tree/master/GridpackWorkflow/production/models
In each folder there is a fragment with a template SLHA where we change the masses depending on the mass point.

Our MadGraph setup is contained in the genproductions package:
https://github.com/cms-sw/genproductions
The instructions on using it being here:

This twiki talks about the MG card setup within CMSSW (e.g. we do not use a param card, but we have instead a customize card used to change parameters in the param card). It also gives the command on how to produce a gridpack.
From there on Pythia runs from within CMSSW with the type of setup/slha that I linked above.
Here is for example the command that would produce an AOD for a random mix of T1tttt scan points:
https://cms-pdmv.cern.ch/mcm/public/restapi/requests/get_test/SUS-RunIISpring16FSPremix-00002
The slha being in the python config (should be the same as the one in github, if everyone committed as they should :)

If you want to just run the GEN step (no SIM. RECO) then you can do a command like in this script:
